# Hardwire

Hardwire is a toy project aiming to provide similar services to wetransfer.
In the past, I was using a self hosted Nextcloud docker instance which was very ressource consuming and quite slow to deliver static files.

The project is developed with Rust language and SQLite on server side and use Tailwind CSS.

Currently it lacks: 
- Unit/Integration tests and by extension Continous Integration
- Admin UI
- Usage stats
- Clean warnings
- Metadata associated to media files (crawled from TMDB for example)
- and many more...

Very basic, probably not production ready except if you're willing like me to have your hands dirty :)

    USAGE:
        hardwire [OPTIONS]

    OPTIONS:
        -f, --filename <FILENAME>    Filename to publish
        -h, --help                   Print help information
        -s, --server                 Server
        -V, --version                Print version information


## Create the first Admin user

1. First, run database migrations:
```bash
make db-migrate
# or
sqlx migrate run
```

2. Get your Google ID:
   - Go to [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)
   - Click on "OAuth 2.0 Configuration" in the top right
   - Select your OAuth credentials
   - Choose "Google OAuth2 API v2" from the list
   - Select "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile" and "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
   - Click "Authorize APIs"
   - After authorization, click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
   - Click "Step 3 - Configure request to API"
   - Make a GET request to https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo
   - In the response, you'll find your Google ID in the "id" field

3. Insert the first admin user in the SQLite Database:
```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (email, google_id) 
VALUES ('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-google-id');
```

After this setup, you can use the admin API to manage other admin users.

## Recent Architecture Improvements (2024-10-19)

The project has undergone significant architecture improvements. See [IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) for complete details.

### Key Changes:

1. **üîí Security** - Moved all secrets to environment variables with validation
   - No more hardcoded `JWT_SECRET`
   - Required: `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - See `.env.example` for complete configuration

2. **üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling** - Implemented comprehensive error type system
   - Type-safe error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Structured JSON error responses
   - Security-aware (internal errors not exposed to clients)

3. **üß™ Testing** - Added test infrastructure
   - Test utilities and helpers
   - Integration tests for core functionality
   - Easy to extend with new tests

### Quick Start:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Generate secure JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# 3. Edit .env with your values
nano .env

# 4. Run tests
cargo test

# 5. Start server
cargo run -- --server
```

See [IMPROVEMENTS.md](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed documentation.
